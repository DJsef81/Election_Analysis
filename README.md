## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given you the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election. 

1. Caclulate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who recieved votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate recieved. 
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won. 
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.9.0, Visual Studio Code, 1.49.3

## Summary 
The analysis of the election show that:
- There were 369,711 votes cast in the election. 
- The candidates were:
  - Charles Casper Stockham
  - Diana DeGette
  - Raymon Anthony Doane
- The Candidate results were: 
  - Charles Casper Stockham recieved 23% of the vote and 85,213 number of votes.
  - Diana DeGette recieved 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes. 
  - Raymon Anthony Doane recieved 3.1% of the vote with 11,606 number of votes.
- The winnner of the election was:
  - Diana DeGette, who recieved 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes. 

## Challenge Overview
Based on our findings in our summary, Dinan DeGette came out as the clear winner with almost 3/4ths of the total votes. In second place was Charles Casper Stockham with almost 1/4th of the total votes. In a distant third was Raymon Anthony Doane. 

Adding all our candidates vote percentages leaves us with a 99.9% total. While that's not a definite 100%, it's pretty close, and has no affect on the outcome. 

## Challenge Summary
In conclusion, Diana DeGette is the clear winner, but we are not sure why. We would need more information to understand why her victory was so emphatic. Was she already the congressional representative? If not, who was? Was that person running in this election? There are too many unknown variables to understand why, but as for who won, that is not in question. Diana DeGette won with almost 3/4 of the total votes cast.
